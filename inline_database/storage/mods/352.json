Please disable Custom Haptics in Tweaks55 to avoid unintended behavior!**  \n**Tweaks55 disables clash particles and haptics together, overriding this mod. Use Particle Overdrive or BS+'s GameTweaker to disable clash particles if you still want clash haptics!**  \n**Has only been verified to work using Quest 2 with Touch Controllers and Quest Link OpenXR runtime. Other headsets, controllers, or runtimes may not work!**": null
